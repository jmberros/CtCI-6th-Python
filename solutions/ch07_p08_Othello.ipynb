    "Othello is played as follows:\n",
    "- Each Othello piece is white on one side and black on the other.\n",
    "- When a piece is surrounded by its opponents on both the left and right sides, or both the top and bottom, it is said to be captured and its color is flipped.\n",
    "- On your turn, you must capture **at least one** of your opponent's pieces.\n",
    "- The game ends when either user has no more valid moves.\n",
    "- The win is assigned to the person with the most pieces.\n",
    "- Implement the object-oriented design for Othello.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extra assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- N x N board? N = 5? It can be generalized to any N\n",
    "- How many pieces are there?\n",
    "- How do you move the pieces? Assuming you can grab your piece and put it in any free slot.\n",
    "- How many moves per turn? Assuming 1 move of a piece of yours to any slot.\n",
    "- What is the initial setup of the game? It has to have immediate valid [capture] moves"
